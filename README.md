# Welcome to MonoGo!

Cross-Platform .NET 8 C# 2D game engine build ontop of MonoGame.

# Setup

The easiest way of using this game engine is to install the templates:
- ```dotnet new install MonoGo.Templates```

If you prefere a more manual process you could also install the packages one by one in your existing MonoGame project like this:
  - ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine```
  - ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.DesktopGL``` or ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.WindowsDX```
  - ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.Pipeline```

- Install **Optional** Packages (You don't need to!):
  - ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Tiled```
 
Of course it's also possible to build everything from source and working directly with the engine, which is very useful for debugging.
