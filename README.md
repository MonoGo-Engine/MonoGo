# Welcome to MonoGo!
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MonoGo.Engine?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=E73C00&logoSize=auto&label=MonoGo.Engine&labelColor=262626&color=707070)](https://github.com/MonoGo-Engine) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-MonoGo.Templates-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=NuGet&logoColor=0289CC&logoSize=auto&colorA=262626&colorB=707070)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGo.Templates) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/MonoGo-Engine/MonoGo/Documentation?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitbook&logoColor=E2B004&logoSize=auto&labelColor=262626&color=707070)](https://monogo-engine.github.io/monogo.github.io/)

Cross-Platform .NET 8 C# 2D game engine build ontop of MonoGame.

# Setup

### Automatic
The easiest and recomended way of using this game engine is to install the templates for Visual Studio:
- ```dotnet new install MonoGo.Templates```

### Manual
- ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine```
- ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.DesktopGL``` or ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.WindowsDX```
- ```dotnet add package MonoGo.Engine.Pipeline```
- ```dotnet add package NPLEditor.Task``` [(i)](https://github.com/BlizzCrafter/NPL-Editor) or ```dotnet add package MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task```

- Install **optional** [modules](#modules).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The engine needs to load engine specific content, which isn't available as a nuget package. But you could just copy over the "Engine" folder of the [sample project](#sample-project) and you should be good to go!
> This step is only neccessary when installing everything manually. The Visual Studio templates are coming with everything needed to directly start using the engine!

---

> [!NOTE]
> You could also clone this repo and work directly with the source code which is useful for debugging!
